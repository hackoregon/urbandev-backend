Hack Oregon Data API
# Portland Datasets

This application exposes a set of micro-services; APIs that can be used for building data visualization mashups. 

Each [REST style API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is designed to expose a single dataset that covers the area of the City of Portland.

The following datasets are currently available:

- [Building Permits](/services/permits)
- [Neighborhood Boundaries](/services/neighborhoods)
- [Crimes](/services/crimes)
- [Taxlots](/services/taxlots)
- [Census](/services/census)
- [Demolitions](/services/demolitions)

It is assumed that these APIs are called from JavaScript via Ajax calls.
