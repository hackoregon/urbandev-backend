Analysis of Hack Oregon's Urban Development data
2016-03-15

Four database tables were used for the PlotPDX application (http://www.plotpdx.com/prototype/) that was built in Fall 2015. The following tables give some meta data about those database tables, such as number of records, date range, and number of unique values for data that appears in choice lists currently or data that might appear in choice lists in the future.

  * crime3-20160310_2304-Desc.csv
  * demolitions-20160310_2232-Desc.csv
  * neighborhoods-20160315_0053-Desc.csv
  * permits2-20160310_2235-Desc.csv

All of the tables have a "shape" column, but we ignored those for presenting meta data.
